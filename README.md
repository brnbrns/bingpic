# bingpic
Simple Python program to change desktop wallpaper to Bing Image of the Day

This Python program currently changes the desktop background on OS X to the Bing Image of the Day. It can be run by running "./bingpic.py" or "python bingpic.py" from the directory where bingpic.py is stored.

In the future this program will be tweaked to work on Windows and Linux, and will update the desktop every day without input from the user.
